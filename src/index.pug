          The data here is randomly generated, and the style is awful, but I threw
          it together (literally in half an hour) as a quick sample of how we could
          visualise some of the data from the league.

          <button id="randomizeData">Load Next Player</button>
        p.
          (This button pretends to be loading a new player's data, but it's
          really just randomizing the graph again.)
